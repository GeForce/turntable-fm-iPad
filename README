This is NOT the code to the real Turntable.FM iPhone app!!!

This code was written for iOSDevCamp 2011's hackathon.
The code was "clean room" reverse engineered from the API used by the turntable.fm web application.
Also the code was written during a 48 hour hackathon and is therefore an example of VERY bad code.
Finally, because this is not supported by turntable.fm in any way shape or form the code may very well break at a moment's notice.

You have been warned.
