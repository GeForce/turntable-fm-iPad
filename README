This code was written for iOSDevCamp 2011's hackathon.

See https://plus.google.com/107337313990587082676/posts/Me7kaF2e77h for more information.

The code was reverse engineered from the API used by the turntable.fm web application.
Also the code was written during a 48 hour hackathon and is therefore an example of VERY bad code.
Finally, because this is not supported by turntable.fm in any way shape or form the code may very well break at a moment's notice.

You have been warned.
